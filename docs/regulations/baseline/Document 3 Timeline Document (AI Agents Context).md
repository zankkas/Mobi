## **MOBI AI Agent Context - Simulation-First Development**

### **Project Context**
Building MOBI ride-hailing platform MVP focused on Brazilian municipal legal compliance validation through simulation rather than real operations. Pilot uses 3 drivers with manual insurance, emphasizing legal document generation and municipal reporting automation.

### **Development Philosophy**
- **Buy UI templates, build legal engine** - Focus development effort on compliance automation
- **Simulation-first validation** - Test legal requirements without real trips
- **Minimal viable validation** - Prove legal concept before full implementation

### **Technical Focus Areas**
1. **OS (Ordem de Serviço) Legal Document Generation** - Core legal requirement
2. **Municipal CSV Export Automation** - Decreto 48.612/2021 compliance
3. **Audit Trail System** - 5-year retention requirement
4. **Simulation Engine** - Realistic trip scenario generation for testing

### **Timeline Structure**
- **Week 1:** Legal engine development (OS generation, CSV export)
- **Week 2:** Simulation system and bulk testing (100+ simulated trips)
- **Week 3:** Legal validation and UI template integration

### **Success Criteria**
Legal validation through simulation demonstrating automated compliance with Rio de Janeiro and Niterói municipal requirements before proceeding to real pilot operations.

### **Key Constraints**
- Manual insurance management for pilot
- File-based municipal integration (not API)
- LGPD basic compliance only
- Ultra-lean approach prioritizing legal validation
