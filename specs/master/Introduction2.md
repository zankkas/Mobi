## **1. Introduction**

## **What MOBI Is**

MOBI is a compliance technology platform born from the lived experience of professional drivers who face a legal paradox: they want to work independently with their own clients, but lack the infrastructure to generate proper documentation, exposing them to fines and legal vulnerabilities.

MOBI was founded by Marconi, a professional driver who experienced firsthand the pressures of ride-hailing platforms—abusive fees, lack of client control, and the legal risks of working "off-platform." His vision: _"Give drivers the right to work within the law."_

**MOBI is a SaaS platform that:**

- **Digitally generates and registers Ordem de Serviço (OS)** for every trip
    
- **Does NOT connect passengers to drivers** (no marketplace, no matching)
    
- **Does NOT charge per-trip fees** (subscription-based model)
    
- **Acts as technology infrastructure, not a service intermediary**
    
- **Provides legal protection, traceability, and compliance** for independent operators
    

**Core principle:** MOBI does not mediate, contract, or manage trips. It documents and legitimizes services that drivers already provide to their own clients.

## **Purpose of This Briefing**

This document provides context on MOBI's **MVP** (what we're building first to test with 3 initial drivers) and **future vision** (where the platform may expand) to enable a thorough legal assessment.

**We acknowledge gaps in our understanding and welcome your expertise in identifying risks, alternative structures, or blind spots we haven't considered.**

Our questions represent known uncertainties—but we're equally interested in: **What are we missing?**
