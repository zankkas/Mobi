## **What MOBI Is

**MOBI was born from lived experience.** Marconi, a professional driver and MOBI's CEO, faced firsthand the contradictions of Brazil's mobility sector: abusive platform fees, lack of client control, professional devaluation, and the legal risk of working "off-app" with private clients.

_"I lived the reality of a driver who wants to work well, with ethics, but gets pushed into informality. MOBI exists to give drivers the right to work within the law."_ — Marconi, CEO

**MOBI is a technology platform (SaaS) designed for independent drivers and private transport operators.** It bridges the gap between informality and legality, enabling drivers to operate professionally with proper documentation and security.

**What MOBI does:**

- **Digitally issues and registers Ordem de Serviço (OS)** for every trip
    
- **Does NOT connect passengers to drivers** (no marketplace)
    
- **Does NOT charge per-trip fees** (subscription-based)
    
- **Acts as a technological and documentation tool, not an intermediary**
    
- **Guarantees legality, traceability, and legal protection**
    

**What MOBI transforms:**  
"Off-platform" transport → Legal, documented, professional service

**Core principle:**  
MOBI does not mediate, contract, or manage trips. It documents and legitimizes operations that drivers already perform with their own clients.
