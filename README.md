# MOBI: Compliance Platform for Independent Drivers

## 📋 About MOBI

MOBI is a compliance technology platform designed to help independent Brazilian drivers operate legally by automating the generation and registration of **Ordem de Serviço (OS)** documents for every trip. 

**Important**: MOBI is NOT a ride-hailing marketplace. We do not:
- Connect passengers with drivers
- Charge per-trip fees
- Control pricing or manage bookings

Instead, MOBI provides:
- Digital OS generation and registration
- Legal protection and traceability
- Compliance infrastructure for independent operators
