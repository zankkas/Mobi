# MOBI

A technology platform (SaaS) designed for independent drivers and private transport operators in Brazil's mobility sector.

## What MOBI Is

MOBI was born from lived experience. Marconi, a professional driver and MOBI's CEO, faced firsthand the contradictions of Brazil's mobility sector: abusive platform fees, lack of client control, professional devaluation, and the legal risk of working "off-app" with private clients.

"I lived the reality of a driver who wants to work well, with ethics, but gets pushed into informality. MOBI exists to give drivers the right to work within the law." — Marconi, CEO

MOBI is a technology platform designed to bridge the gap between informality and legality, enabling drivers to operate professionally with proper documentation and security.

## What MOBI Does

- **Digitally issues and registers Ordem de Serviço (OS)** for every trip
- **Does NOT connect passengers to drivers** (no marketplace)
- **Does NOT charge per-trip fees** (subscription-based)
- **Acts as a technological and documentation tool, not an intermediary**
- **Guarantees legality, traceability, and legal protection**

## What MOBI Transforms

"Off-platform" transport → Legal, documented, professional service

## Core Principle

MOBI does not mediate, contract, or manage trips. It documents and legitimizes operations that drivers already perform with their own clients.
